Description: When using linear and noise free Independent Component Analysis, the separated signals
    have arbitrary variance. This package provides an alternative to the assignment of variance, by estimating
    the variance represented by a signal with respect to the total variance of the set of mixtures. This is termed
    the Percentage of Variance Explained (PVE). Note that no formal proof of this estimation is currently availible.
